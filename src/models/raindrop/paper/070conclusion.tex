We introduce \model, a graph-guided network for irregularly sampled time series. \model learns a distinct sensor dependency graph for every sample capturing time-varying dependencies between sensors. The ability to leverage graph structure gives \model unique capability to naturally handle misaligned observations, non-uniform time intervals between successive observations, and sensors with varying numbers of recorded observations. Our findings have implications for using message passing as a way to leverage relational information in multivariate time series.
